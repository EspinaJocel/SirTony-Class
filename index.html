                        <p>I wasn’t too enthralled with 3YE’s debut year sound, but February’s Queen hit me unexpectedly hard. 
                            I appreciated how it drew from older K-pop elements, largely foregoing trends. 
                            That song alone made me anticipate the group’s eventual comeback. For the first time, a 3YE track 
                            arrived with expectations. And judging from my initial shoulder shrug reaction to YESSIR, expectations 
                            can be a dangerous thing.<br>

                            In reality, I still prefer YESSIR to 3YE’s 2019 material, but it loses some of the 
                            fun electro spark that made Queen such a treat. Instead, the song feels like a spiritual successor to Everglow’s 
                            Dun Dun, given a brassy makeover to compliment the year’s trends. YESSIR is loud… pretty much from beginning to end.</p>

                        <p>3YE pronounced as third eye, a name that suprises everyone is a 3 member girl group 
                            that mainly does girl crush concepts.
                            I first found the group with Queen which is a very confident banger. And it might 
                            sound odd since girl crush is everywhere but their songs still manage to sound fresh 
                            for the concept, maybe because of the larger focous on rap in their tracks.
                            And maybe its just me but a kpop trio feels fairly rare outside of sub units for larger groups.
                            They also have one of the weirder physical albums ive seen. Their last album Triangle is triangle 
                            shaped and instead of a photo book has big triangle cards.</p>
